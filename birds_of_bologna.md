Got it! Based on your rules—light gamification, ability to share short messages, fun and lightweight, mobile-first, accessible via a QR link at the physical festival, and possibly a first-person perspective like a bird flying through the park—here’s a tailored concept for the virtual extension of Festival Cineporto 2025. It ties into the festival’s themes of community, identity, and urban landscape exploration while keeping it engaging and accessible.
Concept: "Birds of Bologna" - A Mobile Micro-Adventure
Imagine this: Festival-goers scan a QR code at Parco 11 Settembre 2001 and enter a mobile web app where they become a little bird exploring a stylized version of the park. It’s a first-person, playful experience that’s light on resources, fun to navigate, and encourages small interactions and sharing—perfect for people on-site or joining remotely.
How It Works
Entry Point  
Visitors scan a QR code on festival signage, leading to a mobile-optimized web app (no download needed, built with something like HTML5 or a tool like Three.js for lightweight 3D).  
They’re greeted with: “Welcome to Parco 11 Settembre 2001! You’re a bird soaring through Bologna’s heart. Explore, chirp, and connect!”
Gameplay: Fly, Discover, Interact  
Navigation: In first-person view, users “fly” through a simple, colorful 3D rendering of the park using touch controls (swipe to turn, tap to move forward). It’s not a heavy game—just a breezy, intuitive experience.  
Landmarks: The park has hotspots tied to festival themes—e.g., a Music Nest, Art Tree, Food Branch, or Story Sky. Tapping a hotspot reveals a micro-experience:  
Music Nest: Hear a short festival tune and “chirp” a note back (record a 3-second sound).  
Art Tree: View a mini-gallery of user sketches and add a doodle.  
Food Branch: Unlock a Bologna-inspired flavor tip (e.g., “Taste the city: basil and mortar”) and share a food memory.  
Story Sky: Read a collective tale and add a sentence.
Gamification: Collect “feathers” (points) by visiting hotspots or interacting. No complex scoring—just a light nudge to explore (e.g., “5 feathers = Fledgling of Bologna!”).
Sharing Little Messages  
At each hotspot, users can leave a “chirp”—a short message (up to 50 characters, like a tweet snippet). Examples: “Love the park vibes!” or “Bologna sings to me.”  
Chirps appear as floating notes in the virtual park, visible to others, fostering a sense of community.  
Option to share a chirp to X with #Cineporto2025, linking the virtual and social worlds.
Light and Fun Vibe  
The bird perspective keeps it whimsical—think of it as a playful avatar connecting people to the park’s spirit.  
Bright, minimal graphics (cartoonish trees, glowing hotspots) ensure it runs smoothly on any mobile device.  
Sound effects like chirps or rustling leaves add charm without overwhelming.
Mobile-First Design  
Built for phones: one-handed controls, fast loading, and no app store hassle (just a web link via QR).  
Works on-site (e.g., “Fly to the stage where the band’s playing!”) or remotely (e.g., “Imagine Bologna from afar!”).
Technical Notes
Platform: A web-based tool like A-Frame or PlayCanvas could deliver this without heavy development. It’s lightweight, QR-accessible, and mobile-friendly.  
Scope: Keep the park map simple (a few key zones, not a full 1:1 replica) to avoid lag and complexity.  
Team: You’d need a basic web developer and a designer for the visuals—nothing too resource-intensive.
Why It Fits
Festival Themes: The bird’s-eye view mirrors the exploration of Bologna’s landscape and identity, while chirps reflect emerging rituals and stories.  
Rules: It’s lightly gamified (feathers), shareable (chirps), fun (flying!), and mobile-first (QR entry).  
Experience: On-site visitors can play while wandering the festival, and remote folks can join the flock, blending physical and virtual seamlessly.
Sample User Flow
Scan QR at the park entrance.  
Open the link, see yourself as a bird atop a virtual tree.  
Swipe to fly toward the glowing Music Nest, tap to hear a riff, and chirp: “This beat’s alive!”  
Collect a feather, spot other chirps (“Sunset here is magic”), and fly to the Art Tree.  
Share your favorite chirp to X and keep soaring.
What do you think? Does “Birds of Bologna” feel like the right vibe, or should we tweak it—maybe adjust the bird idea or add more interactivity?
