# Cylindrical LED Generative Art Simulation

This project is a Python-based simulation of a cylindrical LED display, featuring dynamic generative art with a 3D cylinder, advanced shaders, particle systems, and frustum calibration. Inspired by Raven Kwok’s installation at UFO Terminal in Shanghai, it leverages PyOpenGL to create immersive, real-time visuals approximating a professional LED art piece.

## Features
- **3D Cylinder Model**: A fully rendered cylindrical mesh with 64 segments, simulating an LED surface.
- **GLSL Shaders**: Perlin noise, wave patterns, and lighting for vibrant, organic visuals that wrap around the cylinder.
- **Frustum Calibration**: Perspective projection with a positioned camera, mimicking real-world LED alignment.
- **Particle System**: 1000 dynamic particles with 3D motion and fading lifespans, overlaying the cylinder.
- **High Complexity**: Combines geometry, shaders, and physics for a dense, professional-grade display.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.6+**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **Dependencies**:
  - `pygame`: For window management and event handling.
  - `PyOpenGL`: For OpenGL rendering.
  - `numpy`: For efficient matrix and array operations.

Install dependencies via pip:
```bash
pip install pygame PyOpenGL numpy


Installation
Clone or download this repository:
bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd cylindrical-led-simulation
Ensure dependencies are installed (see above).

Run the script:
bash
python main.py
Usage
Launch the script to see a 1200x600 window displaying the simulation.

The cylinder rotates implicitly via shader animations, with patterns evolving over time.

Particles spawn, move, and fade, creating a dynamic overlay.

Close the window (click the "X") to exit.
How It Works
Geometry: A create_cylinder function generates a 3D mesh with vertices, normals, and texture coordinates.

Shaders:
Vertex shader: Transforms 3D positions with an MVP (Model-View-Projection) matrix.

Fragment shader: Uses Perlin noise and polar coordinates for generative patterns, with basic lighting.
Frustum: A perspective matrix positions the camera 3 units back, simulating LED calibration.

Particles: A simple physics system updates 1000 particles, drawn as OpenGL points.
Performance
Tested on a mid-range GPU at 60 FPS.

May lag on weaker hardware due to 1000 particles and complex shaders.

Optimization options (e.g., instancing) could improve performance further.
Limitations
Video Specificity: Designed as a general approximation of Raven Kwok’s style, not an exact replica of the UFO Terminal video.

2D Input: Lacks real-time interactivity (e.g., mouse/keyboard controls).

Hardware: Requires a decent GPU for smooth rendering.
Potential Improvements
Add specific patterns (e.g., spirals, grids) based on video details.

Implement shader instancing for particle efficiency.

Introduce user controls for rotation, speed, or color.

Export visuals to video or real LED hardware.
Inspiration
This project draws from Raven Kwok’s work on a cylindrical LED setup at UFO Terminal, Shanghai (August 2024), as seen in his X post: link. It aims to replicate the generative art aesthetic and technical approach (e.g., frustum calibration) in Python.
