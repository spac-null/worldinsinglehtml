Cybernetic Glitch Live Feed Generator
Overview
This Python script transforms live video input from a webcam into a cybernetic, glitchy visual effect inspired by futuristic, digital aesthetics featuring pixelation, colored noise, scan lines, glowing particles, binary code overlays, and dynamic color shifts. It includes a fine-tuning control board with 15 adjustable parameters for real-time customization, allowing users to replicate intricate effects like those seen in cyberpunk art or digital glitch imagery.
The script uses OpenCV for video processing and NumPy for efficient array operations, delivering a real-time experience with a high degree of customization and visual complexity.
Features
Real-time webcam video processing with glitch effects.

Pixelation, glitch shifts (horizontal and vertical), and colored noise (red, green, blue).

Scan lines, glowing particle effects (dots and streaks), and binary code overlays.

Dynamic color channel shifts, contrast boosting, and subtle blur for depth.

Interactive fine-tuning board with 15 trackbars for adjusting parameters like pixel size, noise intensity, particle density, and more.
Requirements
Python 3.7 or higher

Required libraries:
opencv-python (for video processing)

numpy (for array operations)
Installation
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the directory containing the script (cybernetic_glitch.py).

Install the required dependencies using pip:
bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
Ensure you have a webcam connected to your computer.
Usage
Run the script:
bash
python cybernetic_glitch.py
Two windows will appear:
"Cybernetic Glitch Feed": Displays the live video with applied effects.

"Fine Tuning Board": Allows real-time adjustment of effect parameters via trackbars.
Use the trackbars to tweak the effects to match your desired aesthetic:
Adjust Pixel Size, Glitch Shift X/Y, Noise Intensity, Red/Green/Blue Noise, etc., to customize the glitch, noise, and particle effects.

Increase Particle Density and Streak Intensity for glowing dots and trails, or enable Binary Code Opacity for digital code overlays.
Press q to quit and close the windows.
Configuration Options
The script includes the following adjustable parameters via trackbars:
Parameter

Range

Description

Pixel Size

1-50

Size of pixelation blocks for a blocky effect.

Glitch Shift X

0-30

Horizontal pixel shift for glitch distortion.

Glitch Shift Y

0-30

Vertical pixel shift for glitch distortion.

Noise Intensity

0-255

Overall strength of colored noise overlay.

Red Noise

0-100

Intensity of red channel noise.

Green Noise

0-100

Intensity of green channel noise.

Blue Noise

0-100

Intensity of blue channel noise.

Scan Line Freq

1-50

Frequency of horizontal scan lines.

Particle Density

0-100

Density of glowing particle dots.

Particle Speed

0-20

Speed of particle movement across the frame.

Streak Intensity

0-100

Intensity of red/green streaks (light trails).

Binary Code Opacity

0-100

Opacity of binary code (0/1) overlay.

Color Shift Freq

0-50

Frequency of random color channel shifts.

Contrast Boost

100-200

Contrast enhancement for brighter effects.

Blur Radius

0-10

Subtle blur radius for depth and softening.
Troubleshooting
Webcam Not Detected: Ensure your webcam is connected and the correct index is used in cv2.VideoCapture(0). Try cv2.VideoCapture(1) or another index if multiple cameras are available.

Performance Issues: On slower hardware, reduce Particle Density, Color Shift Freq, or Noise Intensity to improve frame rate (target 20-25 FPS).

Trackbar Not Responding: Ensure the "Fine Tuning Board" window is active and focused while adjusting trackbars.

Black Screen or Errors: Verify that OpenCV is properly installed and your webcam permissions are granted (on some systems, you may need to run the script with administrative privileges).
