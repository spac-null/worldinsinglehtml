Got it! Based on your rules—light gamification, ability to share short messages, fun and lightweight, mobile-first, and tied to a QR code invitation link for festival-goers at Parco 11 Settembre 2001—here’s a tailored idea for the virtual extension of Festival Cineporto 2025. I’ll refine it to fit your needs and keep it simple yet engaging.
Concept: “Parco Postcards” - A Mobile Micro-Community Playground
Overview: A mobile-optimized web app accessible via a QR code, where users create and share digital “postcards” inspired by the festival’s themes of collective identity and urban landscape. It’s a light, playful way to connect physical attendees and virtual participants, with subtle gamification to keep it fun.
How It Works
Entry via QR Code  
At the festival, attendees scan a QR code (on posters, tickets, or signage) that opens the web app in their mobile browser—no app download needed.  
Remote participants can access it via a shared link (e.g., on the festival’s website or X).
Core Activity: Create a Postcard  
Users craft a digital postcard tied to Bologna and the park:  
Message: A short text field (e.g., 100 characters) for a micro-story, ritual idea, or urban reflection (e.g., “Bologna hums with secrets under the trees”).  
Visual: Pick from a small set of festival-themed graphics (e.g., park sketches, abstract patterns) or snap a quick photo if they’re onsite.  
Mood: Add a “vibe” tag like “Dreamy,” “Bold,” or “Nostalgic” to personalize it.
Takes 1-2 minutes—quick, light, and mobile-friendly.
Light Gamification  
Stamps: Earn a virtual “Parco Stamp” for each postcard made (e.g., “Storyteller,” “Dreamer”). Collect 3 stamps to unlock a special festival badge.  
Highlight Reel: Each day, a few postcards are spotlighted on the app’s homepage (random or curated), giving users a fun “Will I get picked?” thrill.  
No heavy competition—just a sprinkle of reward to nudge participation.
Sharing & Connection  
Users can share their postcard as a link (e.g., via WhatsApp, X, or SMS) or download it as an image.  
A “Postcard Wall” shows a scrolling feed of everyone’s creations, letting users browse and “heart” favorites.  
Keeps it social and bite-sized, like flipping through a guestbook.
Tied to the Physical Festival  
Onsite prompts (e.g., “What sound does the park make today?”) encourage attendees to engage while at Parco 11 Settembre 2001.  
Virtual users get broader prompts (e.g., “What’s your city’s heartbeat?”), linking back to the festival’s identity exploration.
Why It Fits Your Rules
Light Gamification: Stamps and highlights add a playful nudge without complex points or leaderboards.  
Short Messages: 100-character limit keeps it snappy and mobile-friendly.  
Fun & Light: Quick postcard creation and a colorful, casual vibe make it feel like a digital toy.  
Mobile-First: Built as a responsive web app, it works seamlessly on phones via QR scan.  
QR Link: Easy access for physical attendees, with shareability for remote folks.
Tech & Look
Platform: A simple web app using HTML/CSS/JavaScript (e.g., hosted on Firebase or Netlify) keeps it lightweight and low-cost.  
Design: Bright, sketch-like visuals inspired by Bologna’s charm—think hand-drawn trees, arches, and warm tones.  
Scale: Starts small (one postcard type) but could expand (e.g., add music snippets or AR filters later).
Example User Flow
Scan QR at the park → Land on “Parco Postcards” welcome screen.  
Tap “Make a Postcard” → Write “The park whispers summer” → Pick a tree sketch → Tag it “Dreamy.”  
Save it, earn a “Dreamer” stamp, share it on X with #Cineporto2025.  
Browse the Wall, heart a postcard saying “Bologna’s pulse is in its people.”
Feedback Time
This keeps it simple, mobile-first, and tied to the festival’s spirit of creativity and community. Does “Parco Postcards” feel like the right vibe? If not, I can tweak it—maybe lean more into the park’s layout or adjust the gamification. What do you think?
